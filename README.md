# HexGridLib
A C# hex grid generation library based off the great article at http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/

Almost all of the calculations in this library are credited to the link above. A couple years ago I needed to make a hex grid for 
a project and found this site was an amazing source of information. If you wish to learn more about what all the math means 
please go to their site and check it out.

You can see a demo of what I created at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKiaNnem5LE
